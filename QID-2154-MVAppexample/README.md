[not-vali-S] reads the Swiss banknote data (bank2.dat) and spheres them to run Exploratory Projection Pursuit (EPP) on them. We select n (=50) randomly chosen one dimensional projections in the six-dimensional space of the data. For each set of projected data the Friedman-Tukey-Index is applied to judge the "interestingness" of the projection.
