# QID-1199-MVAcltbern
Illustrates the (univariate) Central Limit 
Theorem (CLT). n\*1000 sets of n-dimensional Bernoulli samples are
generated and used to approximate the distribution of
t = sqrt(n)\*(mean(x)-mu)/sigma -> N(0,1). The estimated density 
(blue) of t is shown together with the standard normal (red).
