Reads the Boston housing data (bostonh.dat) and spheres them to run Exploratory Projection Pursuit (EPP) on them. We select n (=50) randomly chosen one dimensional projections in the space of the data. For each set of projected data the Sibson Jones index is applied, which considers the deviations from the normal density for univariate data, to judge the "interestingness" of the projection.
